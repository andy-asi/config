     If any of these are totally unfamiliar, go back to vimtutor and catch up.

     Just like vimtutor, this document is intended to be used interactively.
     Please try all the exercises, and even more importantly, try to use them
     in your day-to-day text editing.

     Do not rush. You will learn best if you do a small amount at a time, and
     try to apply what you learn in real situations. Don't move on until

          - you learn to use the command without thinking too hard,
            or
          - you decide you don't really want to use it anyway.

     You don't have to learn everything, just the parts you find useful.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Lesson 8: FILLING IN THE BLANKS

     Vimtutor introduces many commands, but skips closely related alternate
     commands. This section will introduce the alternate versions of the
     commands you already know. It should also help reinforce your knowledge.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       Lesson 8.1: PAGING AND BACKSPACING

  1. In Lesson 1 you learned to move around with h,j,k,l. Press j and k to
     move down and up.

  2. <C-D> and <C-U> move your cursor and screen down and up by half a page at
     a time. Browse the document and come back.

NOTE: <C-D> means CTRL-D, that is, press the control key and the letter D.

  3. Lesson 1 also taught you to use x to delete characters. Upper-case X is
     similar, but deletes the preceding character. Use x and X to fix up the
     sentence marked ---> below.

NOTE: Use u to undo if you make a mistake.

---> I want somQQe ice creQam nowQQQQQ.

NOTE: Typically, the upper-case version of a command in normal mode does
      something similar, but different.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                      Lesson 8.2: MANY WAYS TO INSERT MODE

             ** Press I to insert at the beginning of the line. **
       ** Press C to chop off the end of the line and insert new text. **

  1. You know to use i, a, and A to insert, append, and append at the end of
     the line. Try these again.

  2. There are many other ways into Insert mode. Move your cursor to the
     middle of the first line marked ---> below.

  3. Press  k  to go one line up.

  4. Press  I  to insert the beginning of the sentence and make it look like
     the line below it.

  5. Press <ESC> to leave insert mode.

  6. Move your cursor to the W on the second line marked --->.

  7. Press  C  to chop off the end of the line, and then type it in correctly.

     ng of this sentence was missing.
---> The beginning of this sentence was missing.
---> The end of this senWQEEXNMOXQXEMDF MSFMP IEXMXPFD!
---> The end of this sentence is now ungarbled.

NOTE:     I           Insert text at the beginning of the line, but after any
                      whitespace.
          C  c$       Delete the rest of the line and enter insert mode.
          S  cc       Delete the whole line and enter insert mode.
          s           Delete one character and enter insert mode. If there is
                      a visual selection, delete that.

NOTE: All these letters enter insert mode:  a A i I s S c C o O

NOTE: R  enters replace mode, which is similar to insert mode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           Lesson 8.3: WORD MOVEMENTS

              ** Use the W, B, and E keys to move among words. **

     Movements commands can be used alone, just to move, or after an operator,
     to influence what it operates on.

     Lesson 2 taught you that  w  moves to the next word, while  dw  deletes
     to there.

  1. Move the cursor just after the first ---> below.

  2. Press  w, W, b, B, e, and E  to move forward and backward one word or
     one WORD at a time. Try them all here:

---> A sentence with words and "-WORDS-" in it.
---> Some words have *special* charac-ters or #punctuation aroun'd them.
---> When taken together, these are considered WORDS.
---> A long WORD: http://some.example.org/url.html

NOTE: w, b, and e operate on words. words can NOT have a mix of punctuation
      and alphanumeric characters. A sequence of punctuation is its own word.

NOTE: W, B, and E operate on WORDS. WORDS are only delimited by whitespace,
      and can therefore include letters, numbers, and punctuation.

      This URL is made of one WORD, or eleven words:

      WORDS:   http://some.example.org/url.html
      words:   http  ://  some  .  example  .  org  /  url  .  html

  3. Using only  W  and  B,  move your cursor to the WORD '*special*' above.
     Then press  dW  to delete the WORD.

  4. Using only  W  and  B,  move your cursor to the word 'together' above.
     Press  cw  and change it to 'combined'.

  5. Move only with  w, W, b, B, e, and E,  and make three more changes with
     these commands:  d2W  c3w  dE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    Lesson 8.4: SENTENCE, PARAGRAPH MOVEMENT

     Vim also understands paragraphs and sentences.

  1. Press  {  and  }  to move from paragraph to paragraph.

  2. Press  (  and  )  to move among sentences.

  3. Place your cursor at an earlier section in this file.

  4. Press  vap  to visually select a whole paragraph.

  5. Press  d  to delete the selected paragaph.

  6. Find another paragraph and press  dap  to delete it immediately.

  7. Press  p  to put the paragraph somewhere else.

  8. Try the following commands around the file:

           cip      Change inner paragraph (do not touch the space around it).
           d3}      Delete from here through the next 3 paragraphs.
           {d3}     Go to the beginning of this paragraph, and then delete 3.
           das      Delete a sentence.
           d)       Delete to the end of the sentence.
           d(       Delete to the beginning of the sentence.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Lesson 8.5: MAGIC CHARACTERS IN SEARCH

  1. Turn on search match highlighting. Type  :set hls  and press enter.

  2. Lesson 4 taught you to use  /text  to search for text. Try searching for
     four stars (****) below by typing  /****  and press enter.

  3. Notice that you get an error. The reason for this is that some characters
     have a magic meaning in search, by default.

  4. Instead, type  /\*\*\*\*  and press enter. The  \  character removes the
     magic meaning from each star.

NOTE: Remember to use  n  and  N  to jump to the next and previous matches.

  5. Now type  /\V****  and press enter. The  \V  sequence removes the magic
     meaning from all subsequent characters.

---> Some text within which to search for **** stars and such things....
---> More text with tricky **** characters....

NOTE: The magic characters that may cause you trouble are:

            ^ $ . * [ / \ ~

NOTE: The magic that is happening is actually regular expressions. There are
      entire books on the subject, so it will not be fully explained here. For
      more information, see  :help regexp

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        Lesson 8.6: MAGIC CHARACTER MEANINGS

      This section will very briefly describe the meanings of the default
      magic characters in search (regular expressions).

            ^     This character matches the beginning of a line as though
                  that were a character. It is only magic when used at the
                  beginning of the search pattern.

            $     Matches the end of a line. It is only magic when used at
                  the end of the search pattern.

            .     Matches any character except a line break.

            *     Means that the preceding character can be matched zero or
                  more times. E.g.  ba*  matches all these:
                      'b'  'ba'  'baa'  'baaa'  'baaaa'  ...

            [     Specifies a group of characters, only one of which must
                  match. E.g.  b[eoy]  matches  'be'  or  'bo'  or  'by'.

            /     Indicates the end of the search pattern. Must be escaped
                  with a backslash, even when using \V.

            \     Removes (or adds) magic on the next character.

            ~     Matches the last used substitute string. This helps you
                  search for  new  after a  :%s/old/new  substitution.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                       Lesson 8.7: VISUAL SELECTION MODES

     Lesson 5 taught you that  v  enters Visual mode, in which you can select
     multiple characters.

  1. Move your cursor to the T in the first line marked ---> below.

  2. Press  v  to enter visual mode.

  3. Press  e  several times to extend the selection to the end of the next
     word.

  4. Press  o  to switch the cursor to the other end of the selection.

  5. Press  w  several times to shrink the selection by a word at a time.

  6. Press  b  several times to re-grow the selection by going back a word
     at a time. Press <ESC> when done.

---> There are three distinct visual modes:
---> Character-wise, in which you select characters in reading order,
---> Line-wise, in which you select whole lines, and
---> Block-wise, in which you select a rectangular block of characters.

  7. Make sure your cursor is still in the ---> marked area, and press  V
     (uppercase) to enter visual line-wise mode.

  8. Press  j  and  k  until all four lines are selected. Notice that
     pressing  o  still switches to the other end.

  9. Press  d  to delete the selected lines. Press  u  to undo the deletion.
     Press  gv  to get your visual selection back.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                     Lesson 8.7: VISUAL BLOCK MODE AND MORE

  1. Move your cursor to the X on the first line below marked --->.

  2. Press  <C-V>  to enter visual block mode.

  3. Press  j  three times so that the bad characters XQZ# are all selected.

  4. Press  r,  to replace them all with commas.

  5. Press  fs  to find the next s character.

  6. Press  .  to repeat the last change.

---> A man, a planX a canals Panama!
---> A van, a planQ a canals Panava!
---> A car, a planZ a canals Paraca!
---> A nan, a bran# a lanars Banana!

NOTE: Two extremely powerful commands were sneaked into this section:
            fx     to find the next character x.
            .      to repeat a change.
      These will be explained in more detail. For now, try making some more
      visual block selections. What happens when you use  d  (delete) and
      p  (put)?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                         Lesson 8.8: YANK AND SHORTCUTS

  1. Lesson 6 taught you that  y  is used to yank (copy) text.

     {{TODO: yy Y, relation to dd cc D C etc.}}

  2. Press  yy  to yank a whole line. Try it and use  p  to put (paste).

NOTE: yy  is similar to  dd  to delete a whole line and  cc  to change a whole
      line.

  3. You can also use  Y  which does the same thing.

NOTE: Y  is NOT similar to  D  (delete the rest of the line) or to  C  (change
      the rest of the line). You may expect  Y  to yank the rest of the line
      but it does not. Use  y$  for that. You can fix this inconsistency with:

          :nnoremap Y y$

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                Lesson 8 SUMMARY

     To move a half page down press:   <C-D>
     To move a half page up press:     <C-U>

     To delete the character to the left of the cursor:    X
     To insert text at the beginning of the line:          I
     To change from the cursor to the end of the line:     C
     To change (substitute) the whole line:                S

     To delete, change or yank a paragraph:  dap  cap  yap
     To delete, change or yank a sentence:   das  cas  yas

     To remove the magic meaning from characters in search, use:   \
     To turn off all magic in search, add a  \V  to the beginning, e.g.
            /\Vsafe*to[search]

            ^ $ . * [ / \ ~

     In visual mode, to move the other end of the selection:    o
     To select whole lines visually:                            V
     To select a block of text:                                 <C-V>
     To get your visual selection back after losing it:         gv

     To yank (copy) a whole line:     yy   Y

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           Lesson 9.1: SEARCH TRICKS

  1. If you're brave, search for the URL below, marked --->, by typing:
         /http:\/\/192\.168\.0\.11\/\~bs\/page\.html?lang=en_us

NOTE: That is AWFULLY hard to type. It's hard to remember which characters
      are magic. Forward slashes cannot even be made non-magic with  \V.

  2. Try this search instead:
         /http:..192.168.0.11..bs.page.html?lang=en_us

---> http://192.168.0.11/~bs/page.html?lang=en_us

NOTE: Technically, that could match something you're not interested in, but it
      is unlikely. If you're not too picky, just use  .  to match any character
      where it makes things easier.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                Lesson 9.2: THE BENEFIT OF THE MAGIC CHARACTERS

  1. Think about how you would search for all HTTP URLs that end with '.htm'
     What other tools might you use?

  2. Turn on highlighting by typing   :set hlsearch

  3. Search the text below marked ---> by typing:
         /http:\S*\.htm\>

---> This url is bad http://example.net/some/path.txt but this next one is
---> good http://example.net/some/path.htm, as it starts with
---> http: and ends with .htm  <--- however, that doesn't match because there
---> are http://spaces.local/in/it.html ... http://secure.local/urls.htm
---> should https://not.match.example.org/the/pattern.htm nor
---> should this http://wrong.local/extension.xhtm

  4. Make sure your search found exactly two URLs in the above text. If not,
     fix your typos and try again. You can use the up arrow to recall your
     last search.

     Let's examine the parts of the search pattern to understand it:

         http:    This part is literal. It matches 'http:' literally.
         \S       Magically matches any one non-whitespace character.
         *        The star means the previous character can appear zero or
                  more times. That is, zero or more non-whitespace characters.
         \.       Matches a literal dot. Without the slash it would match
                  any single character.
         htm      Matches 'htm' literally.
         \>       Magically matches the end-of-a-word.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                Lesson 9 SUMMARY

     {{TODO}}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                           Lesson 10.1: KEY MAPPINGS

  1. Type this, literally, including the angle brackets, then press enter:

          :nmap <F2> ^y$:<C-R>"<CR>

     What it means:
          :nmap is a command that remaps a key or keys, in normal mode,
          <F2>  is the key to remap, it could also be a sequence of keys,
                The rest of the line is the sequence of key presses that will
                result from pressing <F2>:
          ^     goes to the beginning of the line,
          y$    yanks to the end of the line, not including the line break,
          :     is just like the one in :nmap -- it is the start of a command,
          <C-R> is control-R, which fetches the contents of a register,
          "     is the name of the register that contains the most recently
                yanked text,
          <CR>  means Carriage Return; it completes the command.

     What it does:
          It copies the current line into command mode and executes it.

  2. Now you can run lines from this file as commands, just by pressing <F2>.

     Try it now. Move the cursor to the line below, and press <F2>:

          :nmap <C-DOWN> ddp

  3. Now if you hold Control, and press the down arrow, the line will move
     down. Use it to fix the lines below:

---> d) Can you learn too?
---> c) Intelligence is learned,
---> a) Roses are red,
---> b) Violets are blue,
